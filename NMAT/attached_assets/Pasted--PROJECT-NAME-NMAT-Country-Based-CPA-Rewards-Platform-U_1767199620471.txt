🔗 SMART LINK & TASK SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
Smart Link Rules

That single smart link contains multiple offers/surveys inside OGAds

Task (Tag) Logic

Admin can create MULTIPLE TAGS using the same smart link

Example:

Tag 1 → USA Smart Link

Tag 2 → USA Smart Link

Tag 3 → USA Smart Link

Each tag represents a new opportunity to complete a different offer inside OGAds.

Task Completion Rules

When user clicks a tag:

Redirect to OGAds smart link
