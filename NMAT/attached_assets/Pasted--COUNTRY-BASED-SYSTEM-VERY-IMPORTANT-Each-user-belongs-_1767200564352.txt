🌍 COUNTRY-BASED SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each user belongs to ONE country permanently

Each task (tag) belongs to ONE country

Admin chooses the country when creating a task

Users can ONLY see tasks assigned to their country

Users from other countries must NOT see those tasks

🔗 SMART LINK & TASK SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
Smart Link Rules

Admin will use ONE OGAds smart link per country

Example: USA Smart Link

That single smart link contains multiple offers/surveys inside OGAds

Task (Tag) Logic

Admin can create MULTIPLE TAGS using the same smart link

Example:

Tag 1 → USA Smart Link

Tag 2 → USA Smart Link

Tag 3 → USA Smart Link

Each tag represents a new opportunity to complete a different offer inside OGAds.

Task Completion Rules

When user clicks a tag:

Redirect to OGAds smart link

When user returns:

DO NOT auto-credit

Wait for OGAds postback

If OGAds confirms completion:

Mark tag as COMPLETED

Credit user balance

Completed tag:

Must be locked

User can NEVER complete it again

If user fails or abandons a tag:

No credit

User can try another tag

Each new tag should trigger different offers

Prevent offer repetition for completed tags

🔁 POSTBACK SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Implement OGAds postback URL

Postback must:

Identify user

Identify tag

Credit balance

Lock completed task

Prevent duplicate postbacks

Secure postback with validation
